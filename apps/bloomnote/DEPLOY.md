# Deploying bloomnote → bloomnote.aidenjang.com

**Status: not yet deployed** (first deploy is step 3.7). One Cloudflare Worker (`bloomnote-api`)
serves both the API (`/api/*`, `/health`) and the web SPA on one origin, `bloomnote.aidenjang.com`.
Gardens live in a KV namespace (`GARDENS`). Free tier; you pay only for DNS.

Accounts are optional and use the shared auth service (`accounts.aidenjang.com`): the browser
redirects there for sign-in/out, and bloomnote validates the `platform_session` cookie
server-side via `/api/me`. The cookie is scoped to `.aidenjang.com`, so it's shared with owewell.

All commands run from `apps/bloomnote/api`.

## First deploy (once, in order)

```bash
# 1. Create the garden store, then paste the printed id into wrangler.toml,
#    replacing "local-dev-placeholder" under [[kv_namespaces]].
pnpm exec wrangler kv namespace create GARDENS

# 2. Garden generation key (Gemini). Optional — without it, /api/design-garden returns 503
#    gracefully and the rest of the app still works.
echo "<gemini-api-key>" | pnpm exec wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY

# 3. Custom-domain two-step: a Worker needs a deployment before a custom domain attaches.
#    - Comment out the [[routes]] custom_domain block in wrangler.toml.
pnpm run deploy            # builds bloomnote-web, then wrangler deploy (first deployment)
#    - Uncomment the [[routes]] block.
pnpm run deploy            # redeploy to attach bloomnote.aidenjang.com
```

- `AUTH_URL` is committed in `wrangler.toml` `[vars]` (`https://accounts.aidenjang.com`), so no
  auth secret to set. The account already has a `workers.dev` subdomain, so `error 10063` won't recur.

## Routine redeploy

```bash
pnpm run deploy            # builds the SPA + deploys (use whenever web/ changed)
pnpm exec wrangler deploy  # API/config-only change (reuses the last-built SPA)
```

## Dependency: the auth service must be current

bloomnote's sign-out redirects to `accounts.aidenjang.com/logout`. That route + the copy fix
were added after auth's original deploy, so redeploy auth too (from `apps/auth/api`):

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

Otherwise sign-out falls through to `/account` and doesn't clear the session.

## Smoke test (verify SSO + /mine cross-device)

```bash
curl https://bloomnote.aidenjang.com/health          # {"status":"ok","service":"bloomnote"}
curl https://bloomnote.aidenjang.com/api/me            # {"user":null} when signed out
```

Then in a browser:
1. Anonymous: create a garden, open its `/g/<id>` link — works with no account.
2. Click **Sign in** (top-right) → lands on `accounts.aidenjang.com`, sign in → back to bloomnote.
   If you're already signed into owewell, this should be seamless (shared `.aidenjang.com` cookie).
3. `/mine` → your **Sent** garden appears; any anonymous gardens made on this device get claimed.
4. Open someone else's `/g/<id>` while signed in → it shows under **Received**.
5. Cross-device check: sign in on another browser/device → the same Sent/Received lists load
   (they're server-side in KV, not localStorage).

## Local dev (no Cloudflare needed)

```bash
# auth (:34100) + bloomnote API (:32200) + bloomnote web (:32100)
cd apps/auth/api     && pnpm exec wrangler dev --port 34100 --inspector-port 9229 --local
cd apps/bloomnote/api && pnpm exec wrangler dev --port 32200 --inspector-port 9231 --local --var AUTH_URL:http://localhost:34100 --var GEMINI_API_KEY:<key>
cd apps/bloomnote/web && VITE_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:34100 pnpm dev
```

The web dev server proxies `/api` → the Worker at `:32200`; `VITE_AUTH_URL` points sign-in at the
local auth service instead of prod.
