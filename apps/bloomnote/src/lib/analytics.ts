// Typed wrapper around Vercel Analytics's `track()` function.
//
// Why a wrapper instead of calling track() directly:
//   1. Event names are a closed enum — typos become type errors at the
//      call site instead of mystery splits in the dashboard between
//      e.g. `garden_generated` and `garden_genrated`.
//   2. Each event documents the exact shape of its props next to its
//      name, so it's obvious what's worth tracking.
//   3. One module to scan when adding a new event — no hunting through
//      Composer.tsx and RecipientView.tsx to remember what we already
//      named things.
//
// Privacy posture: no PII. We deliberately do NOT log message text,
// sender/recipient names, or anything from the garden contents — only
// structural metadata (counts, types, flags). The free Vercel
// Analytics tier is cookie-less and anonymizes IP + UA at the edge,
// so no cookie consent banner is required.

import { track } from '@vercel/analytics'

// The Vercel SDK accepts these property value types.
type EventProps = Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>

// All custom events flow through here. Wrapping it gives one place to
// add (e.g.) sample rates, prod/dev gating, or batched reporting later
// without touching call sites.

  // No-op outside a browser context — protects against any future SSR
